# PyAsm
A bytecode-engineering library for python 3.11.

## Installing
This project does not have a pip package (yet). To install it, the `assembler.py` file needs to be copied into the project it's used in.

## Usage
This library (obviously) requires a lot of knowledge about python's bytecode syntax. If you're unsure about certain things, you can use python's `compile` combined with `dis` to figure certain things out. Here's an example:
```python
import dis
def dump(source):
    compiled = compile(source, "", "exec")
    dis.dis(compiled)
dump("print(123)")
```

The `examples.py` file contains examples on how to use the library. The documentation in the library itself also contains some useful help.

## Documentation
Documentation on the specific instructions can be found at [the `dis` python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dis.html#python-bytecode-instructions).

If you wonder how specific python snippets look like in bytecode, refer to [usage](#usage)

## Notes
- The resulting assembly generated by this project **needs to be run with python 3.11**. No version below 3.11 will be able to parse the bytecode generated with this libary, due to pretty significant changes to the format.
